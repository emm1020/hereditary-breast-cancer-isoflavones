# Study Overview

This study evaluated whether dietary isoflavone (ISF) intake was associated with breast cancer (BC) risk, particularly for molecular subtypes such as Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2+, and Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), in women at high risk for hereditary BC in Korea.

### Design
- Retrospective cohort study using participants from the Korean Hereditary Breast Cancer (KOHBRA) study.
- n = 1,709 participants (BRCA1/2 carriers and high-risk non-carriers).

### Variables
- **Exposure**: Isoflavone intake (low / intermediate / high), based on FFQ data.
- **Outcomes**: Incident breast cancer and its subtypes.
- **Adjustment factors**: Birth cohort, marriage, parity, family history, energy intake, physical activity, alcohol use.

### Key Models
- Weighted Cox Proportional Hazards Model
- Logistic Regression for case-only gene-environment interaction

### Software
- SAS 9.4 (Base, Macro, and SQL)
